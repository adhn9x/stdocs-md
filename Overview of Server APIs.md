# Overview of Server APIs

This article gives you a glance at all the server APIs currently supported by SeaTalk Open Platform. For a detailed introduction to a particular API, click on the hyperlink to visit the respective API documentation.

# Core Concepts

1. **Service Scope**: the service scope of your app refers to who can see and use your app on SeaTalk.
2. **Data Scope**: the data scope of your app refers to whose employee data your app can retrieve and update.
3. **Permission**: the permission of an API gives your app the access to send requests to the API endpoint. If you find that an API your app needs to call requires API permission,[configure your app's permission list](/docs/build-an-app-for-your-team) to include that API.

The list of server APIs below summarises the specific APIs provided and whether a particular API needs the configuration of availability, server API as well as API permission. This information is also stated in each API doc.

# List of Server APIs

Note:

1. To call the APIs that require Service Scope configuration successfully, your app has to be released first. SeaTalk Open Platform will check the **Effective Service Scope** of your app configured in the release detail.
